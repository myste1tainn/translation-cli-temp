Using the following Financial Data and provided list of Topics to answer in the provided Exampel Output,
where value is a calculation of that subtopic deriving from the Financial Data.

DO (example)
- if the data is i.e. "Periods", and there are multiple periods - then say "A - B" where A is the started periods, B is ended
- if the data is i.e. "Rounding", then find common rounding that is being done and use that i.e. Millions, Billions, if there's no rounding in the Finincail data calculation then say None
- if the topic / data cannot be found then put null as value
- remove the prefix "Topic/Subtopic" from the name field
- if the value is number, then make it string
- for those that the data cannot be found, put "N/A" as value
- list all topics & subtopic
- foreach topic + subtopic must have same number of rows per dimensions found in the data i.e. Consolidated + Separated and
  year 2023 and 2022 then foreach topic + subtopic must have 4 rows (2x2 dimensions)

DO NOT
- put the value per period, only the final value should be in "value"
- make the "value" property as array "values"
- put your opinion to value field, all value field comes from Financial Data / Calculation possible from Finincial Data for topics
- if the value is string of number, do not format it, leave it plain string of number
