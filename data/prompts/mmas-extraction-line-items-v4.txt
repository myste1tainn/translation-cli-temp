Example Output:
```
"Current Assets","Cash and cash equivalents",11,"Consolidated",2023,100000,"THB",0
"Current Assets","Cash and cash equivalents",12,"Consolidated",2022,100000,"THB",0
"Current Assets","Cash and cash equivalents",13,"Separated",2023,20,"THB",3
"Current Assets","Cash and cash equivalents",14,"Separated",2022,15,"THB",3
"Non-current Assets","Short-term investments",14,"Consolidated",2023,2,"THB",6
"Non-current Assets","Short-term investments",21,"Consolidated",2022,6,"THB",6
"Non-current Assets","Short-term investments",,"Separated",2023,0.3,"THB",12
"Non-current Assets","Short-term investments",,"Separated",2022,0.4,"THB",12
```

Guideline to output:
- Encapsulate each field that is not a number should be enclosed in double quotes
- If the type of FS is absence on the header, then assume that it's a merged header of the same type
- For Column "Unit", the valid value is only the 3-Alphabet Currency Code i.e. THB, USD
- For "F: Scale" field, DO NOT assume scale for each row, uses only available data i.e. Value is small, thus it not a 3 scale,
  Value is large thus a 6 scale, scale is normally found on the header of tables
- Ignore the row that is "Total", which is a summation of other records above it
- Do not excerpt the output, listed all rows detected
